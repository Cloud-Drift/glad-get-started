# glad-get-started
This repository contains a notebook to get you started with the [GLAD dataset](https://data.griidc.org/data/R1.x134.073:0004) using the [*clouddrift* library](https://clouddrift.org/).


This notebook should be readily executable in a binder environment which can be launched by clicking the "launch binder" badge above ☝️. Alternatively, you can run the notebook in a python environment containing the python libraries listed in the file environment.yml.

Feel free to contribute to this repo or raise an issue!
